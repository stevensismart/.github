## 🔬 About Us
The **I-SMART Lab** focuses on applying satellite remote sensing, geospatial modeling, and advanced data analytics to address critical issues in hydrology, climate, and environmental monitoring.  
We aim to develop innovative solutions for **water resources management, climate change adaptation, and disaster resilience**.  

Our mission is to:
- Enhance scientific understanding of environmental processes through remote sensing.  
- Develop models for monitoring **land, ocean, and atmospheric systems**.  
- Provide actionable knowledge to policymakers, industries, and communities.
